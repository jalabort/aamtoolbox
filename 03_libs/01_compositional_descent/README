libaam_code - a library for efficient fitting of active appearance models
=========================================================================

  This is a C++ implementation of the method CODE in [Amberg09]. CODE is a
  compositional appearance model fitter using gradient descent in a suitable
  prepared compositional space. It is much more robust than "Inverse
  Compositional Image Alignment (ICIA)" while being about as fast. 

  The most current version of this library can be found at
  http://www.cs.unibas.ch/personen/amberg_brian/aam/

Prerequisites
=============
  - Blas, Lapack
  - Cmake
  - Matlab
  - Boost

  Only the fitting algorithms have been ported to C++, learning and
  precomputation are done with matlab. You will therefore need matlab to learn
  new active appearance models. An active apperance model of a face is included
  in this distribution.

  The algorithm relies on BLAS+LAPACK for its matrix operations. You will
  therefore need a working BLAS+LAPACK installation. The algorithm was tested
  with the Atlas and MKL implementations under 64 bit Linux.

  The build system used is cmake, so you will also require a cmake installation.

  And the example applications use boost to parse the commandline, so you also
  need a boost installation.

Installation
============

Linux
-----
    tar -xvvjf libaam_code-1.0.tar.bz2
    cd libaam_code
    make

  will compile libaam_code in the directory ../build, install it to ../install.
  
  You can then run the example application in ../install/share/doc/aam_code_mex/example/
 
  You can edit Makefile to change the installation directory. If you do that after the first compilation
  you need to remove the directory ../build.
 
  add the directory ../install/matlab/code-1 to your matlab search path to be
  able to create new AAMs. See ../install/share/doc/aam_code_mex/example/*.m
  for a usage example.

Apple Macintosh
---------------
  The library was not tested under the Apple OS


Windows
-------
  The library was not tested under windows

Usage
=====
  After building you can refer to ../install/share/doc/libcode/ for usage instructions.
